# STRAFE 64 — Map Design Doc & Direction

_Where the game is heading, and the rules the procedural generator follows to
get there._ Written 2026-06-18. Companion to [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (the
work backlog), [MOVEMENT.md](MOVEMENT.md) (the physics), and
[ART_DIRECTION.md](ART_DIRECTION.md) (the look).

This doc is the bridge between **design principles** (synthesised from Neon
White, Titanfall 2, Ghostrunner, Mirror's Edge, Quake/Defrag/surf, Trackmania,
Clustertruck, DOOM Eternal) and **generator parameters** — the actual knobs in
[strafegen.py](../tools/strafegen/strafegen.py). Every principle below is tagged
with its status against the current engine:

- **[x] shipped** — exists and is wired
- **[~] partial** — half-built or needs a feel pass
- **[ ] proposed** — the generator/engine doesn't do this yet; this is the spec

A confidence note carried from the source research: qualitative principles are
well-corroborated; hard numbers come from two tiers — **(physics)** constants
from the Quake/surf community (high confidence) and **(derived)** ratios I've
turned into starting parameters (tune in-engine, not gospel).

## 0. The thesis — what this game IS

**Movement is the game; combat is fused into movement; the world is a course you
flow through, lap after lap, chasing the discovered millisecond.**

The core verb chain — already named across the codebase as the **flow loop** —
is:

> **Descend → Tighten → Revector → Slice → Release**

(gravity donates speed → the line narrows → you carve into a new heading off a
banked wall → you cut a sliceable enemy at the apex → the kill surges time/speed
into a bhop landing, and the next descent begins.)

Everything in this doc serves making that loop **readable at speed**,
**replayable**, and **addictive**. The three pillars the whole design optimises:

1. **Never force a full stop.** No beat in any generated map may require zero
   velocity to clear. (Titanfall's continuous-mobility invariant.)
2. **The kill is a consequence of moving, not a reason to stop.** (DOOM Eternal
   push-forward; Neon White enemies-as-waypoints.)
3. **The dopamine is the discovered millisecond.** Deterministic-per-seed
   courses you route-learn; ghost-by-default racing; ms-resolution scoring that
   always rewards the fast line. (Trackmania + Neon White.)

Where we already are: the surf core loop ([SurfLine](../tools/strafegen/strafegen.py)),
the lap→points→shop→again cycle, the ghost system, sword bullet-time slowmo,
slice-drone gates, the LATTICE mode, and the dev-texture readability palette all
exist. Where we're going: turning the *generator* from "valid + varied geometry"
into "geometry that obeys the seven principles below."

---

## 1. Enemy placement — kills reinforce movement

The slice-drone ([`Course.place_drone`](../tools/strafegen/strafegen.py),
[`--combat`](../tools/strafegen/strafegen.py)) is the unit here. A drone is a
**gate on the line you cut THROUGH**, not a wall beside it — an un-sliced gate
already passes clean (it doesn't break the line). The katana slice grants a
time-dilation surge (`g_timeBind`, the sword-slowmo identity). That's the fusion
working. The placement rules:

- **[x] Slice grants momentum/time back.** Already true — a swing surges time
  out of the near-freeze floor (`g_timeBindMin`). _Keep this invariant: never
  add an enemy that requires braking. If a kill would need a stop, convert it to
  a parry/deflect the player passes through, or cut it._
- **[ ] Kill lands AT the action beat, place enemy before the corner.** The
  slice should resolve as you carve off the revector wall, so the surge feeds
  the release/bhop. **(derived)** parameter:
  `enemy_offset = corner_position − (jump_distance × 0.7)`. Today `place_drone`
  drops on the line at a `fwd`/`side` offset; the generator should compute that
  offset *relative to the next revector wall*, not free-place it.
- **[ ] Telegraph: face the player, silhouette against contrast, ≥1.5–2 s of
  travel ahead.** **(derived)** Spawn every on-line drone facing the player,
  lit, on a contrasting backdrop, far enough out to be parsed and pre-aimed at
  current speed. Routing happens *before* arrival (Neon White / Ghostrunner
  tactical overlay).
- **[~] Pulse, don't carpet.** Memory
  [strafegen-combat-recipe](../../.claude/projects/-Users-gustav-strafe64-engine/memory/strafegen-combat-recipe.md)
  already lays "2-3 enemy phrases at spice beats; openers/flow = rest." Formalise
  as: **one kill-beat every ~2–4 s of flow, clustered into 2–3-drone phrases
  separated by pure-movement rests. Never >3 simultaneous on-line threats** —
  that forces a stop. **(derived from DOOM wave pacing + Neon White brevity.)**
- **[ ] Rest-beat enemies advance.** Any drone at a rest beat should drift toward
  the line so standing still decays (Titanfall anti-camping).

---

## 2. Corners & bounce geometry — the revector wall

This is where surf/Defrag and Trackmania give us hard, reusable numbers.

- **[x] Surfable bank angle.** **(physics)** A face must be **> 45°** (steeper
  than `MIN_WALK_NORMAL`) to surf — too steep to stand, so you slide and
  air-accel along it. `SurfLine` already lays ramps in the **49–55°** band; the
  community 5:4 rise/run ≈ **51.3°** is the sweet spot. **Keep revector-wall
  pitch in 51–58°** (steeper = harder/slower to read).
- **[ ] Bend ~30–45° per revector, never 90°.** **(physics + folk-canon)** The
  Quake/Source air-accel model only adds speed from the projection of velocity
  onto wish-dir. A hard 90° corner *kills* strafe speed; a series of 30–45°
  kinks reads as a carve and *rewards* carried speed. **Generator rule:
  consecutive line segments bend by 30–45°, chained — not one big turn.**
  `Course.turn()` currently takes arbitrary yaw; constrain the revector emitter
  to the 30–45° band.
- **[ ] Late-apex exit into a straight.** **(Trackmania, derived)** When a
  revector wall is followed by a release/bhop straight, bias the wall so the
  natural exit vector points straight down the next segment — place the wall's
  far edge for a late apex (straighter/faster exit), not a tight clip.
- **[ ] Run-up before every wall.** **(derived)** Precede each revector wall with
  a straight run-up ≥ **1.5×** the player's per-second travel, so the wall is
  visible and the entry angle settable before contact.
- **[~] Banked turns / true 2D circuits.** `SurfTurn` builds a steep banked 180°
  arc (velodrome inner-low/outer-high). If the bank carries speed (human-gated
  feel call, see ROADMAP), fold `arc()` into `SurfLine` so circuits curve in 2D
  instead of snaking one Y-corridor.

> corners = 2×45° bounce-walls on a flat pad; do **not** re-add the velodrome
> floor-bank (it read wrong-way + cost flow).

---

## 3. Verticality — Z donates speed

- **[~] Descent-dominant net elevation.** **(Titanfall)** The *descend* phase is
  a controlled downhill that donates speed (gravity feeds the bhop); *tighten/
  revector* spends it going slightly up or across. **Net elevation per segment
  trends downward** so momentum is always being replenished. `SurfLine` already
  descends ~1792u over its chain; generalise the rule to all course types.
- **[ ] Never hide the landing.** **(Ghostrunner)** Any drop must show its target
  platform / next wall inside the player's forward cone *before* commitment.
  Frame the descent so the next anchor is in-frame at jump-off.
- **[ ] Wallrun arc as connective tissue, gap ≤ max-jump.** **(Titanfall)**
  Wallrun speed builds over time, so the optimal exit is near the run's end —
  put the next anchor there. **Wallrun-to-next-anchor gap ≤ the distance a
  max-speed jump covers**, so "always a path" holds. (Wallrun + `PM_CheckVault`
  mantle exist; the generator doesn't yet *place* wallable surfaces to this
  rule.)

---

## 4. Multiple lines — safe vs fast

- **[~] Safe line + fast line per segment.** **(Neon White gold vs ACE)** Every
  segment ships (a) a **safe line** always completable at moderate speed = gold
  pace, and (b) a **fast line** — a tighter revector, a skip, a sword/rocket-jump
  shortcut — higher-risk, only pays at ACE pace. `Course` has `fork` already;
  the spec is to make one branch *honestly faster* and one *safe*, not just two
  cosmetic paths.
- **[ ] One speed-gated skip per ~2–3 segments.** **(Defrag overbounce-as-content)**
  Intentionally place a skip that bypasses a chunk of the safe line **if the
  player carries enough speed** — gate on a velocity threshold, not a switch.
- **[ ] Forks diverge in a shallow Y, never a T.** **(Mirror's Edge)** Both
  branches keep heading down-line; a route choice never forces a reversal or a
  stop. **Max 2–3 simultaneous lines** — more is unreadable at flow speed.

---

## 5. Readability at speed — the Mirror's Edge rules

These are directly implementable as generator + shader constraints. Our
Source/dev-texture palette (orange floors, grey walls, subtle measure grid — see
memory
[strafe64-source-dev-textures](../../.claude/projects/-Users-gustav-strafe64-engine/memory/strafe64-source-dev-textures.md))
deliberately leaves a clean accent slot for exactly this.

- **[ ] One reserved guidance hue for "the line."** **(Mirror's Edge Runner's
  Vision — red was chosen so players can judge distance)** Reserve **exactly one
  accent hue** for the on-line chain: next anchor, revector wall, on-line
  sliceable enemy. **Forbid that hue everywhere else.** This is the single
  highest-leverage readability change for a proc-gen map.
- **[ ] Light = go, dark = stop.** Light the on-line anchor chain; let off-line
  geometry fall darker. (Generator drives lightgrid / shader emissive on anchors.)
- **[ ] Next anchor within ±30° forward FOV on entry.** When a beat resolves, the
  next point of interest is already in the player's forward cone. Keep momentum
  directional — exit on the same side you entered.
- **[ ] Distinct silhouette + guidance-hue outline per on-line enemy.** Drones
  recognisable at distance so routing happens before arrival; outline on-line
  drones in the guidance hue (Ghostrunner tactical overlay).
- **[ ] Cause and effect in-frame.** A trigger and its result stay in the same
  shot — the player never hunts for what changed.

---

## 6. Rhythm, pacing, escalation

- **[~] teach → combine → test.** **(Ghostrunner three-beat)** Each course:
  segment 1 introduces one new mechanic in isolation at low stakes; middle
  segments combine it with priors; the final segment demands the full chain. The
  existing course recipe (memory
  [strafegen-clustertruck-sections](../../.claude/projects/-Users-gustav-strafe64-engine/memory/strafegen-clustertruck-sections.md):
  speed→flow→spice arc) is the skeleton — escalate *difficulty of the same
  mechanic*, not just variety.
- **[ ] Mandatory rest beats.** **(derived)** A pure-movement rest (no enemies,
  wide line) every **~10–15 s** of intensity; rest length ≈ **30–40%** of the
  preceding intensity block.
- **[ ] Short trials.** **(Neon White — seconds, not minutes)** Target a full
  flow-trial of **~20–60 s**; a single phrase (descend→…→release) **~4–8 s**.
- **[~] Checkpoint before each phrase, instant restart.** **(Ghostrunner cheap
  death)** `Course.checkpoints` already places one respawn per section; the rule
  is **checkpoint before each new mechanic-phrase** with near-zero
  restart-to-control latency (Q3 fire-to-respawn is already near-instant).
- **[x] Never emit a zero-velocity beat.** The generator must never produce a
  gate, valve, or lock that requires standing still. (Currently honoured by
  construction — gaps assume carried speed; keep it an explicit invariant.)

---

## 7. What makes it addictive — the meta loop

This is the layer that turns "a good course" into "one more run."

- **[x] Ghost system.** Record/replay on scaled `cg.time`, finish on real
  `trap_Milliseconds()` (no slow-mo cheat); cyan hologram + trail ribbon. Exists
  (memory
  [strafe64-ghost](../../.claude/projects/-Users-gustav-strafe64-engine/memory/strafe64-ghost.md)).
  **[ ] Make racing your own PB ghost the DEFAULT on restart** — biggest "one
  more run" driver across Trackmania + Neon White.
- **[ ] Tiered, gated leaderboard reveal.** **(Neon White's key trick)** Casual
  play reliably nets gold; the **global** leaderboard only unlocks after you ACE
  a course. Show your own / medal target first → friends → global as you clear
  thresholds. Protects beginners from demoralising times; gates the chase behind
  mastery.
- **[~] High-resolution (ms) scoring that always rewards the fast line.** The
  per-lap payout (lapBonus + speedBonus + bestBonus, PERS_SCORE) and the
  par/medal system (`par_calibrate.py`, `cgp_<map>`, MISSION REPORT S/A/B/C rank)
  exist. **The invariant to enforce: taking the fast line must always out-score
  the safe line.** Score the awake/speed metric continuously at ms resolution; a
  new PB should be celebrated loudly.
- **[ ] Deterministic per seed.** **(Neon White "think three moves ahead")**
  Courses must be **memorisable** — fully determined by their seed.
  **Randomise the seed, not the run.** strafegen is already seed-driven
  (`--daily` = date-seeded, same course worldwide each day); make seed→geometry
  *stable* across generator versions for any seed surfaced to players.
- **[ ] Mastery curve = assistance that fades.** Guidance-hue intensity becomes a
  difficulty/assist slider; the scoring *rewards* turning it down (Mirror's Edge
  Runner's Vision dials off as you improve).

## 8. The map archetypes — current vs. target

| Archetype | Class / flag | Status | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surf circuit** (the core loop) | `SurfLine` / `--surf` | [~] procedural chain, feel-gated | Fold `SurfTurn.arc()` in for true 2D circuits; apply §2–§3 angle/run-up/late-apex rules |
| **Banked turn** | `SurfTurn` / `--surfturn` | [~] 180° arc, no AAS | Validate the bank carries speed; merge into SurfLine |
| **Flow course** | `Course` + `sec_*` / default | [~] section recipe | Re-author sections to §1–§6: slice-at-apex, 30–45° kinks, rest beats, teach→combine→test |
| **Combat-laced** | `Course(combat=True)` / `--combat` | [~] slice-gate phrases | Enforce enemy-offset = corner − 0.7×jump; pulse density |
| **Arena / Pit** | `Arena`, `Pit` / `--arena` | [x] bot-fight pit | Push-forward combat; fight-at-speed boost pads |
| **Killbox** | `Killbox` / `--killbox` | [x] vertical melee + momentum portals | Reuse momentum-portal trick (dest angles[0]>999999 skips velocity reset) |
| **Lattice arena** | `LatticeArena` / `--latticearena` | [x] sealed, 24 spawns, AAS | ≥16 spread spawns to kill telefrag noise; escalate by collapse-rate |
| **Dojo (bot regression)** | `--dojo speed/flow/ztrick/arena/surf` | [x] regression-guarded | Calibration substrate, not a player map |

---

## 10. Open questions / human-gated calls

These can't be measured headlessly (bots can't surf-finish, parry, or feel) —
they need a `\map` playtest:

- The exact revector bend band: is 30° or 45° the carry-speed sweet spot for our
  air-accel constants? (Sweep `pm_airaccelerate` × bend angle.)
- Does `SurfTurn`'s bank carry speed around the arc, or bleed it? (Decides §2's
  2D-circuit merge.)
- `g_bulletSpeed` feel (~0.3–0.5 recommended) so deflectable shots read at normal
  time, co-tuned with the parry window.
- Lattice `g_latticeRadius` (~120–160) + `g_latticeSelfMs` (~900–1200) defaults.
- Guidance-hue intensity default + whether the assist slider should be
  score-rewarded or purely cosmetic.
